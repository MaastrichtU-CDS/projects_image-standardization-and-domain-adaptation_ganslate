# GANslate

`ganslate` is a GAN image-to-image translation framework that is accessible both to beginners, through readable code and documentation, and to advanced users, through easy extensibility for their use-cases or ideas. 

Features:

- 2D and 3D support
- Mixed precison
- Distributed training
- Transparent configuration
- Weights&Biases and Tensorboard logging
- Natural and medical image utilities
- Various generator and discriminator architectures (more coming)
