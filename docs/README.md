# Documentation

Our documentation is based on [Mkdocs](https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs)

The `/docs` folder contains pages of the documentation website, `/imgs` the media used in them.
Mkdocs is configured with `../mkdocs.yaml`, located in the root of the project.

To host locally, run this command from the root of the project:
```
mkdocs serve
```
